title: Linux Router Setup &mdash; NixOS &amp; "v6 plus" edition
hidden: true
---

# Background

I recently moved to Tokyo. The apartment I ended up in has a fiber optic port (conventionally labeled <ruby>å…‰<rp><rt>hikari</rt></rp></ruby>, meaning "light").

(Insert image of the port)

When I signed up for internet, I was warned that I needed a router that
supported "v6 plus". I have a [PCEngines APU2](https://www.pcengines.ch/apu2.htm) running Linux, which I've used as
a router in the states for years.
I had no clue what "v6 plus" was, but I was confident that Linux would support any acronym soup.
In my head, I was expecting to just write the usual router config (you know,
run a dhcp server, flip on `ip_forwarding`, NAT traffic out the WAN interface,
call it a day), and then maybe flip on a "v6 plus" option somewhere in my NixOS config, or at worse as an option on the router's dhcp client or something.

It turns out things are more complicated than I thought. It took a couple days
of fiddling around to actually get things setup. What's more, most of the
resources about "v6 plus" are in Japanese.

I figure it's worth writing up my understanding of this and sharing my router config in case it helps someone out there. Unfortunately, I also don't have a full understanding of all the details, so my explanations will also be lacking!

With that, let's talk about the basics of "v6 plus".

## What is v6 plus?

As best as I can tell, "v6 plus" is a marketing term for two technologies, and
specifically for the deployment of them as commonly used by Japanese ISPs.
The technologies are a lightly idiosyncratic IPv6 deployment, and then a MAP-E based tunnel for IPv4 traffic.

I believe "v6 plus" is primarily meant to help deal with IPv4 exhaustion,
though it seems to also be bundled with using IPoE instead of PPPoE, which also
gives performance improvements. Despite "v6 plus" seeming to imply IPoE, I
don't actually know if there's any technical reason there, and it won't come up
again since that doesn't end up mattering for the router.

So, I mentioned IPv4 exhaustion and MAP-E above. What's MAP-E?

### MAP-E

MAP-E is described in [RFC7597](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7597). It is
a way to subdivide public IPv4 addresses among many end user devices (routers).
The primary alternative (what gets used to deal with IPv4 exhaustion in the US
for example) is CGNAT. While CGNAT and MAP-E accomplish similar goals (multiple
users of one public IPv4 address), they do so in notably different ways.

Most notably, with CGNAT, it's transparent to the customer's router. The router simply
gets an IPv4 address, and then uses it without any further thought. On the ISPs
side, they of course have to do additional work to add a second layer of NAT to
that IP, and also typically to track connection state.

MAP-E is not transparent to the customer's router. Instead, the router is told what IPv4 address it has (which is a real one!), and what ports on that IPv4 address it is allowed to use, and then it is expected to apply its own layer of NAT to ensure all outgoing traffic has a source IP of that address, and a source port of one of the allowed ports.

MAP-E also does one additional thing. It describes how to setup a tunnel to the
IPv6 address of a server which will accept encapsulated IPv4 traffic
(encapsulated using an [IPv4 over IPv6
tunnel](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2473), and then route that traffic to
the public internet.

The majority of MAP-E's spec isn't about the tunnel, mentioned above, though. It's largely about how the router can derive all the necessary information from just the IPv6 address it was assigned.
The "necessary information" in this case is the public IPv4 address to use, the
port ranges to use, the specific IPv6 address to use for its end of the tunnel,
and so on.

I, personally, do not know why they didn't propose new DHCP options for the v6
DHCP server to send down. All this information about how to setup an IPv4
tunnel seems like it doesn't need to be derived in such a roundabout way, and
instead could be given directly to the router using DHCP, or even some other
protocol bootstrapped on top of IPv6 connectivity.

I'll also note that I've seen claims that the MAP-E deployment in Japan isn't
fully spec compliant, but I haven't verified these. It seems quite plausible
though.

#### Benefits of MAP-E

So, what benefits does MAP-E have?

As best I can tell, the main benefit is that the ISP doesn't have to run a CGNAT server. The "Border Relay" server can be relatively simple since it only has to keep track of static information, like "This tunnel, from IPv6 address a:b:c::d can use IPv4 address 1.2.3.4's port 1234". Actually NATing traffic to that ip and port is left up to the consumer's router.

It also doesn't require adding any new DHCP options (as mentioned above), which I guess is some sorta benefit?

It's likely there's other benefits which I don't understand.

#### Downsides of MAP-E

One downside, which I've experienced firsthand, is that routers become more complicated. Having to perform this layer of NAT, setup a tunnel, and perform the encapsulation... it's all a bit fiddly! Also, I think the IPIP tunnels being used can't easily be offloaded to hardware, so it's plausible the consumer routers need beefier CPUs to keep up with line-speed under this scheme.

I'm sure there's other downsides, but so far I haven't found them. Everything I've tried to use has worked fine.

### v6 Plus in Practice

The above is a lot of words to say "you get part of an IPv4 address". What does this look like in practice?

Well, in practice, you get assigned an ipv6 "/64" via DHCP6 to your router. Using that IPv6 address, you calculate your IPv4 address, and 15 port ranges of 16 ports each (so you get 240 ports on your IPv4 address).

You use a hard-coded (as best I can tell) Border Relay server, specific to your ISP, create a tunnel, and setup a bunch of NAT rules.

That's the v4 part of it. Unfortunately, because you are only given a "/64", your router can't subdivide that further, so getting an IPv6 address on your other devices is also complicated. In practice, it seems like people typically use [ndppd](https://github.com/DanielAdolfsson/ndppd) to proxy through neighbor discovery requests to the upstream IPv6 gateway the ISP runs. I'm probably using some terms wrong here since my understanding of this part is a little shaky.

## Other resources

There are a lot of good resources on this stuff.

I would not have been able to configure my own router without consulting the following posts, resources, etc:

* [https://vector.hateblo.jp/entry/2021/02/17/142458](https://vector.hateblo.jp/entry/2021/02/17/142458) &mdash; This is the primary resource I consulted for my entire router setup. Amazingly useful blogpost.
* [https://intaa.net/archives/13173](https://intaa.net/archives/13173) &mdash; This post, and the following two parts, were invaluable for understanding MAP-E better without having to read the RFC :D
* [http://ipv4.web.fc2.com/map-e.html](http://ipv4.web.fc2.com/map-e.html) &mdash; This webpage is referenced all over the place. I ended up [reimplementing](https://github.com/euank/v6plus-tun) its functionality, but it was a vital reference for doing so.

## Router configuration

In this section, I'll link to my router configuration, and talk about a few details of it.

At a high level, I'm using NixOS on a PCEngines APU2 router. I took inspiration from [this post](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2022-08-03-nixos-with-live-usb-router.html) and made a live-USB / "run from memory" NixOS setup.

The configuration I ultimately ended up with is [here](https://github.com/euank/router.nix/blob/0564bc7bd73fe5289b8d7c2e4b1d419ea4916a6e/configuration.nix).

I'll walk through some important sections of it to describe what's going on.

### v6 plus tunnel

This section of the config, specified here, setups up the IPv4 in IPv6 encapsulation:

[configuration.nix#L114-L128](https://github.com/euank/router.nix/blob/0564bc7bd73fe5289b8d7c2e4b1d419ea4916a6e/configuration.nix#L114-L128)

```nix
  systemd.services.v4-plus = {
    enable = true;
    description = "setup v4 tunnel";
    unitConfig = {
      Type = "simple";
    };
    path = with pkgs; [ iptables iproute2 ];
    serviceConfig = {
      ExecStart = "${pkgs.v6plus-tun}/bin/v6plus-tun setup-linux --wan enp1s0 ${inputs.secrets.ipv6_addr}"; # TODO: stop hardcoding
    };
    wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
    # setup ipv4 after ipv6 is up
    after = [ "network-online.target" ];
    requires = [ "network-online.target" ];
  };
```

I didn't mention before, but I checked the IPv6 address I was assigned, and it
hasn't changed yet so I've just hardcoded it. Ideally, this would either check
the configured interface, or check the DHCP6 lease file or such, and use that
value, but in practice it was much easier to hardcode it.

Anyway, this shells out to the "v6plus-tun" rust code I wrote [here](https://github.com/euank/v6plus-tun), specifically [main.rs#L143-L184](https://github.com/euank/v6plus-tun/blob/dcbe753fe505e0306bfe0f62bff6417f09c14c8c/src/main.rs#L143-L184). It's just a bash script in rust btw.

I'll comment on a couple small sections:

* ```rust
  run_cmd!(ip -6 tunnel add $tun_dev mode ip4ip6 remote $br_addr local $edge_addr dev $wan_dev encaplimit none)?;`
  ```

  This creates the actual IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel using the addresses derived from MAP-E. Linux calls these ip4ip6 tunnels

* ```rust
  let mark_base = 0x10;
  run_cmd!(iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING -j HMARK --hmark-tuple sport --hmark-mod $num_ranges --hmark-offset $mark_base --hmark-rnd 4)?;
  for (i, (start, end)) in data.port_ranges.iter().enumerate() {
      let mark = mark_base + i; // arbitrary
      for proto in ["icmp", "tcp", "udp"] {
          run_cmd!(iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p $proto -o $tun_dev -m mark --mark $mark -j SNAT --to $ipv4_addr:$start-$end)?;
      }
  }
  ```

  This marks traffic based on the hash of the source port. In practice, there
  are always 15 sets of 16 contiguous ports, so there's always 15 buckets. We then NAT that traffic to allowed source ports for each bucket and protocol.

  The use of HMARK there is my contribution to linux "v6 plus" setups. Every
  other part of my router setup, I saw someone else doing online, but I didn't
  see anyone else using HMARK. Most of them use "-m statistics" to do every Nth
  packet, but HMARK ends up taking significantly fewer iptables rules, and
  seems like it could be nicer for a few cases as well, since it gives a
  consistent source port in more cases.


For now, I'll leave the rest uncommented (as an exercise to the reader you might say).

### Issues

Currently, I actually have an issue with my router setup which I don't fully
understand yet. I get a small amount of IPv6 packet loss (no IPv4 packet loss),
and don't fully understand why yet.

I intend to figure that out and report back.

### Building and running

The way I've been building and running this router configuration is pretty simple:

1. Install nix
2. From the repo, `make`
3. Plug in usb drive (`/dev/sdb`)
4. `cp ./iso/*/*.iso /dev/sdb`
5. Plug the drive into my router, power cycle it.

That's it, configuration applied. I leave the USB stick in the router so that if there's a power outage, it'll still come up with a correct config.

Note well, there's a [secrets](https://github.com/euank/router.nix/blob/0564bc7bd73fe5289b8d7c2e4b1d419ea4916a6e/flake.nix#L9) input, which contains my assigned IPv6 address, which is required for this to build. I have not checked that input in.

## Conclusion

Overall, I'm moderately happy with this setup. I actually kinda like MAP-E in a weird way after getting it setup. I don't like that I only get a "/64", and honestly that part is way more of a pain than the IPv4 stuff.

I have considered ditching the IPv4 tunnel in favor of a wireguard tunnel that has an IPv4 address (which is another easy way to tunnel IPv4 over IPv6), but so far it's working well enough I doubt I actually will.

I am quite frustrated by my remaining IPv6 packet loss. My internet is very usable, but I do notice it occasionally eating packets, and I really want to know what I did wrong.
I'll write a followup once I figure it out.

Thanks for reading!

If any of this was helpful for your own internet setup, I'd love to hear about it!

Finally, here's a picture of my router next to the NTT ONU. Please ignore the mess of cables, I'll hide it all under some shelves eventually!
