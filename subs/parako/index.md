# Parako subs (WIP)

Let's get some disclaimers out of the way first:

1. I am studying Japanese, and I have a _long way_ to go. There are no doubt
   numerous mistakes of all sorts in this translation. No warranty, etc etc.
2. This is a WIP effort. I may drop it, I may revise parts, idk
3. This is my first time using aegisub, so the timing kinda sucks etc etc.

Okay, disclaimers outta the way, onto the real content

## What's "parako"?

A series of [youtube animated shorts](https://www.youtube.com/@parako), "私立パラの丸高校" or "パラ高" for short.

They're released for free on youtube on the above official channel.

I've chosen to translate the name as "Private High School 'Para-normal'".

## Subtitles

They're all hard-subbed in Japanese, but as far as I can tell, no one has created subs for them in any other language.

I'm giving subbing them in English a go. We'll see how far I get. Currently, the plan is to do one a week, and to go in chronological order.


### Subtitle downloads

* [01 - AM8:30, Test Day](01.ass)
* [02 - An invisible man, but he wears clothes while robbing](02.ass)
* [03 - A too-loud voice, and it all comes to nothing](03.ass)

### Using these files

I recommend using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download the video locally in whatever format you prefer, and then opening the subtitle file with them. If you name the subtitle file to the same thing as the video file (like "01.webm" and "01.ass"), most media players will automatically load the subtitle file.

I personally am using the mp4 format I get from `yt-dlp -f mp4` in association with my .ass files, and I generally verify it all renders correctly in [mpv](https://mpv.io/) using that combination.
