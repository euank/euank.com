# Building a Bamboo Bicycle &mdash; a review of the Bamboo Bicycle Club

While living in Seattle, I got into bicycles as a hobby, and one of the first things that interested me was the different feel of frame materials.

Fortunately, since I had my bicycle stolen roughly once a year, I got to try quite a few different materials out without needing to ever actually deal with storing a full quiver of bikes :D!

At first, I tried more normal stuff, like solid steel, cool carbon fiber, an
alright aluminium one, and eventually a terrific titianium one.

Honestly, I think the titanium one felt the nicest to ride, and I hope whoever stole that one gets some good use out of it!

But, the point is, I was frame-curious, I felt like I tried all the normal things, and then I found out online that you could make bikes out of bamboo, with apparently good ride quality!

You know what comes next, I googled, I found the [Bamboo Bicycle Club](https://bamboobicycleclub.org/), and after the idea bounced around in my head for a couple years, I ordered one.

### Bamboo Bicyle Club kits

So, there's a bunch of people out there who will pre-build bamboo frames (some quite fancy, like [Calfee](https://calfeedesign.com/bamboo/)), but I felt like building it myself would be fun, and the most professional-but-still-cheap kits seemed to be the [Bamboo Bicycle Club](https://bamboobicycleclub.org/collections/home-build-kits) ones.

This was my first time building up a bike, so I figured I'd keep it simple and just make a fixie, so I ordered a road frame kit, borrowed a woodshop from a friend, and got started.

### Bill of Materials (initial)

Financially, my initial estimate for the cost was:

| Item | Cost | New/Used |
|------|------| ------|
| Frame kit | $560 | New |
| Wheels | $267.80 | New |
| Crankset | $100 | New |
| Bottom Bracket | $0 | Recycle from Davidson bike |
| Seat &amp; Seatpost | $0 | Recycle from Davidson bike |
| Fork/steam/headset | $0 | Recycle from Davidson |
| Fixed cog &amp; lock ring | $10 | New |
| Chain | $22 | New |
| Pedals | $57 | New |
| | |
| Total | $1020 | |

This ended up being wrong for reasons we'll get into below! I didn't know what I was doing it turned out!

The initial plan was to recycle as much as I could from my Davidson bike, since the frame had been damaged but the other parts were largely fine, and then for some reason I splurged on the wheels :D

Anyway, let's move on to actually building the thing!

### Doing the build

Note that this blog post is written from memory around 3 years after the fact, so some details are slightly fuzzy!

So, the basic process for building the bikes was this:

1. Consult a 1-1 drawing of the black carbon fiber lugs and bamboo fitted together, determine the depth a piece of bamboo should fit into the lug. Mark that depth with a line.
2. Sand down the bamboo wood until it fits into the lug.
3. Once everything fits together, glue all the ends into the lugs, let it dry!
4. Done! (well, in theory at least)

Unfortunately, I hit problems here....

### Failure 1: Misaligned frame

There were actually multiple things wrong here! Let me simply quote the email I sent to the Bamboo Bicycle Club:

> To: info@bamboobicycleclub.org
> Subject: Raod Carbon Frame Build - some measurement and alignment issues
External
>
> Hello!

> I purchased a road carbon frame kit a month or so ago to build a single-speed bamboo bike.
>
> I took some notes of issues I ran into along the way, and I also ended up with a misaligned rear triangle.
>
> First, I'll talk about the few issues I ran into:
>
> 1. One of the provided seatstays already had a crack in the bamboo before I did anything
>     <img width="300px" src="/imgs/bamboo-bike/seatstay01-crack.jpg"/>
>
>     Q: Is that okay and normal? After sanding and glueing, here's what the crack looks like:
>     <img width="300px" src="/imgs/bamboo-bike/seatstay-crack-02.jpg"/>
> 2. While sanding and fitting the top tube, a small crack developed in that lug
>     <img width="300px" src="/imgs/bamboo-bike/lug-crack-01.jpg"/>
>
>     Q: Is that okay? I've heard horror stories about carbon fractures leading to it shattering down the line.
>
> 3. The 1-1 drawing marks that seatstays should fit 30mm into the seat lug, but the lug also has eyelets 25mm in that extend far enough the bamboo can't fit 30mm deep into the lug.
>     <img width="300px" src="/imgs/bamboo-bike/seatstay-30mm.jpg"/>
>
>     Because of that, I over-shaped the seatstay tubes a little, trying to make them fit 30mm in. This also caused minor damage to the end of the bamboo as I tried to get it to 30mm, and the eyelet pressed into the bamboo unevenly.
>
> 4. The '30mm' for the chainstays into the rear dropout lug was also off since the lug had a hard stop at around 28.5mm. (No picture for this one, but measuring the depth of the rear dropout lug's holes with calipers should confirm).
>
> 5. The seatpost jig is marked slightly wrong on the diagram I think? Either way, I had to move the seatpost jig down or else it would not fit in the seatpost hole. I'm pretty sure the seattube was the marked length on the 1-1 diagram, so I don't think it was just that being off.
>
>     <img width="300px" src="/imgs/bamboo-bike/seatpost-jig.jpg"/>
>
> Finally, let's talk about the rear triangle alignment.
> After glueing+drying the frame, and then putting on the horizontal dropout and rear wheel, the wheel can't be trued. There's a roughly 1/8 inch difference in the length of the seatstays (probably due to my mistakes mentioned in issue 3 above), and the wheel, no matter how I shift it within the horizontal dropouts, won't align along the same vertical axis as the seat post. Either the top or bottom will rub once I put on a tire.
> Pictures don't show it very well, but I'll include one anway. Below, you can see that the wheel is centered between the chainstays, but curves right and nearly touches the right seatstay.
> <img width="300px" src="/imgs/bamboo-bike/wheel-alignment.jpg"/>
>
> Is there any way I can fix this rear triangle alignment issue without starting over with a new kit/frame?
> I still really want to have and ride a bamboo bike, but I'm also quite worried this alignment issue means this frame isn't usable.
>
> I'll repeat the questions with numbers here, which will hopefully make it easier to reference back to them (and they're now in a difference order, order of importance to me):
>
> Q1: Is there a way to fix the rear triangle alignment issue I have? Do I need to start over and use this as a learning experience on the next frame?
> Q2: Should I be concerned about the small crack in the carbon fiber lug (issue 2)
> Q3: Should I be concerned about the pre-existing crack in the bamboo (issue 1)?
>
> Thanks in advance for any help or advice,
> Best,
> Euan
