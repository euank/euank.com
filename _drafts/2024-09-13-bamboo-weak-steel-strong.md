# Building a Bamboo Bicycle &mdash; a review of the Bamboo Bicycle Club

While living in Seattle, I got into bicycles as a hobby, and one of the first things that interested me was the different feel of frame materials.

Fortunately, since I had my bicycle stolen roughly once a year, I got to try quite a few different materials out without needing to ever actually deal with storing a full quiver of bikes :D!

At first, I tried more normal stuff, like solid steel, cool carbon fiber, an
alright aluminium one, and eventually a terrific titianium one.

Honestly, I think the titanium one felt the nicest to ride, and I hope whoever stole that one gets some good use out of it!

But, the point is, I was frame-curious, I felt like I tried all the normal things, and then I found out online that you could make bikes out of bamboo, with apparently good ride quality.

You know what comes next, I googled, I found the [Bamboo Bicycle Club](https://bamboobicycleclub.org/), and after the idea bounced around long enough, I ordered one.

### Bamboo Bicyle Club kits

So, there's a bunch of people out there who will pre-build bamboo frames (some quite fancy, like [Calfee](https://calfeedesign.com/bamboo/)), but I felt like building it myself would be fun, and the most professional-but-still-cheap kits seemed to be the [Bamboo Bicycle Club](https://bamboobicycleclub.org/collections/home-build-kits) ones.

This was my first time building up a bike, so I figured I'd keep it simple and just make a fixie, so I ordered a road frame kit, recruited a friend with a woodworking area onto the project, and got started.
